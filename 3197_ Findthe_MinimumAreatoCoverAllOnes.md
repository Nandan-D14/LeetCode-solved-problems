# ðŸ“˜ 3197. Find the Minimum Area to Cover All Ones

## ðŸ”¹ Problem

We are given a binary grid (`m x n`, up to 30x30).
We must cover **all 1â€™s** in the grid using **3 non-overlapping rectangles** (touching is allowed).

ðŸ‘‰ Goal: Minimize the **sum of their areas**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key Observations

1. With **1 rectangle** â†’ trivial: bounding box of all 1â€™s.
2. With **2 rectangles** â†’

   * Since they cannot overlap, one must be either **entirely above/below** or **entirely left/right** of the other.
   * So we can check **all possible vertical or horizontal splits**.
3. With **3 rectangles** â†’

   * Think of it as: pick **one rectangle**, then partition the remaining 1â€™s into **two groups** (via vertical or horizontal split).
   * Try all possible partitions and minimize.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Preprocessing

We need a fast way to compute **bounding rectangles + area** for subsets of the grid.

ðŸ‘‰ Trick:

* Use **prefix sums (2D cumulative sum)** to quickly check which cells contain 1â€™s inside a subrectangle.
* Then compute the bounding box of those 1â€™s â†’ area = `(xmax - xmin + 1) * (ymax - ymin + 1)`.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Approach

1. Compute the **bounding box area of all 1â€™s** = baseline.
2. For 2 rectangles:

   * Try every **vertical split (column k)** â†’ left part + right part.
   * Try every **horizontal split (row k)** â†’ top part + bottom part.
   * Each side â†’ bounding rectangle â†’ area.
3. For 3 rectangles:

   * First rectangle = bounding box of all 1â€™s in one region.
   * Then split the **remaining ones** into two groups (same as step 2).
   * Try all possible ways.

Since `m,n â‰¤ 30`, brute-forcing all partitions (O(nÂ³)) is feasible.

## ðŸ”¹ Complexity

* Brute force partitions: O((m+n)Â³) in worst case.
* Grid â‰¤ 30 â†’ this is feasible.

---

âœ… This brute-force approach passes because constraints are small (`â‰¤30x30`).
For larger grids, one would need smarter DP with precomputed bounding boxes.
